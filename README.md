# webgl gameoflife visualization

## Overview
Dive into a visually captivating 3D representation of Conway's Game of Life. Built with Electron and WebGL via Three.js, this desktop application brings the classic cellular automaton to life in an interactive 3D environment, showcasing the beauty of algorithmic simulations and the power of modern web technologies.

This project is a minimalist Electron application integrated with Three.js for 3D graphics rendering, using Webpack for efficient code bundling and Babel for JavaScript transpilation. Designed as a starter template, it offers a foundational setup for building desktop applications with rich 3D visualizations and modern JavaScript features.

## Features
* Electron Framework: Leverages Electron for cross-platform desktop app development, enabling the creation of native applications with web technologies.
* Three.js Integration: Incorporates Three.js for rendering dynamic 3D graphics within the Electron application, providing a template for visualizing data, gaming, and more.
* Webpack Configuration: Includes a Webpack setup for bundling JavaScript files, optimizing performance, and supporting modern JavaScript features through Babel transpilation.
* Development Workflow: Offers development conveniences such as hot reloading with electron-reload and a clear structure for expanding the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v12.x or higher recommended)
* NPM (v6.x or higher)

### Installation
* Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/summeroff/webgl_gameoflife_visualization.git```
* Navigate to the project directory:
```cd webgl_gameoflife_visualization```
* Install dependencies:
```npm install```
* Build the project:
```npm run build```
* Start the application:
```npm start```

## Usage
After launching the application, you will see a 3D scene rendered by Three.js within an Electron window. This serves as a starting point for developing your own 3D visualizations, games, or any other desktop applications requiring sophisticated graphics.
